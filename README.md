# Module-2-Portfolio
A portfolio giving a brief description of myself and showcasing my work alongside some contact information. I used a variety of techniques learned in HTML/CSS to properly format my page the way I had it imagined. FlexBox being the main focus as well as the ability to hone in on my Parent/Children containers and how to call properly to my elements, classes, and ID's. Overall I feel as if I grasped the acceptance criteria to the fullest. Definitely could've added more and provided a better sense of critique, yet I didn't wanna spend much time doing so now. As I'm aware we will be coming back to this quite a bit further along.
